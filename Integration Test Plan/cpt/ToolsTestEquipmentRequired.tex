\chapter{Tools \& Test Equipment Required} \label{chap4}
For carrying out the Integration Test we decided to use \textit{Arquillian}, an integration testing framework for Java EE, because it allows to make integration test as simple to write as unit test. Additional test equipment required in order to perform integration test are the GPS receivers specified in the RASD and a smartphone with characteristics that respect all the requirements already defined in RASD itself.
