\chapter{Program Stubs \& Test Data Required} \label{chap5}

\section{Program Stubs}
All the client's inputs will be simulated by specific drivers. There sholud be at least 4 such drivers, one for each type of user of the system.
The Visitor Driver should simulate these inputs:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item creation of a new user (by filling the registration form)
	\item login with proper username and password
\end{itemize*}

The Passenger Driver should simulate these inputs:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item request of a Taxi
	\item reservation of a Taxi
	\item visualization of the Account Page and modification of some personal information
	\item visualization of a receipt
	\item visualization of the Home Page
\end{itemize*}

The TaxiDriver Driver should simulate these inputs:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item visualization of the Dashboard and interaction with the route and with the incoming calls
	\item visualization of the Summary Page
	\item visualization of the Account Page and modification of some personal information
	\item visualization of the Home Page
\end{itemize*}

The Developer Driver should simulate these inputs:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item visualization of the Testing Page
	\item visualization of technical information
	\item insertion of new features or modification of some features
\end{itemize*}

\section{Test Data}
For successfully carrying out the test procedures, all the following tables of the Database must be populated:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item User
	\item Developer
	\item Passenger
	\item TaxiDriver
	\item Passenger Ride
	\item Taxi Ride
	\item City Zone
	\item Taxicab
	\item GPS Receiver
\end{itemize*}
Furthermore, a dataset of location data to simulate inputs from the GPS Receiver  and from the smartphones is needed.
