\section{Assigned Methods}
This section contains the namespace pattern and the name of the methods that were assigned to us:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourceAsStream(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Location}: \textit{appserver/web/web-core/src/main/java/org/apache/\\catalina/core/StandardContext.java}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResource(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Location}: \textit{appserver/web/web-core/src/main/java/org/apache/\\catalina/core/StandardContext.java}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourcePaths(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Location}: \textit{appserver/web/web-core/src/main/java/org/apache/\\catalina/core/StandardContext.java}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourcePathsInternal(\textbf{DirContext} resources, \textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Location}: \textit{appserver/web/web-core/src/main/java/org/apache/\\catalina/core/StandardContext.java}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getRequestDispatcher(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Location}: \textit{appserver/web/web-core/src/main/java/org/apache/\\catalina/core/StandardContext.java}
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Role of Methods}
This section contains the functional role of the methods that were assigned to us:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourceAsStream(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Role}: Return the requested resource as an \textbf{InputStream}. The path must be specified according to the rules described under \textit{getResource}. If no such resource can be identified, return \textbf{null}.
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResource(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Role}: Return the URL to the resource that is mapped to a specified path. The path must begin with a "/" and is interpreted as relative to the current context root.
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourcePaths(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Role}: Return a Set containing the resource paths of resources member of the specified collection. Each path will be a \textbf{String} starting with a "/" character. The returned set is immutable.
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getResourcePathsInternal(\textbf{DirContext} resources, \textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Role}: Internal implementation of \textit{getResourcesPath()} logic.
	\item \textbf{Name}: \textit{getRequestDispatcher(\textbf{String} path)}\\
		\textbf{Role}: Return a \textbf{RequestDispatcher} instance that acts as a wrapper for the resource at the given path. The path must begin with a "/" and is interpreted as relative to the current context root.
\end{itemize}

\section{Issues}
In this section are presented all the issues detected during our code inspection process for each method assigned to us:

\subsubsection{getResourceAsStream(String path)}
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[t]{p{0.35\textwidth}p{0.65\textwidth}}

\hline
\textbf{Checklist Point} & \textbf{Issue} \\
\hline
11 & Every time an \textit{if} statements contains only a \textit{return()} statement in his body, this is not surrounded by braces \\
\hline
15 & At line 7500 the line is broken before the OR operator \\
\hline
18 & Even though all the main classes, methods and interfaces are well commented, there is a large number of blocks of code not commented at all  \\
\hline
25 & The Constructor is placed between Static Variables and  Instance Variables. Private and protected Instance Variables alternates (i.e. line 630) \\
\hline
27 & The entire class consists of more than 8000 lines of code, that are too many. There is not a fixed maximum size for a class, but 8000 lines are surely too many for every style convention commonly used \\
\hline
42 & There is no error message associated with the only one exception present in the method \\
\hline
53 & The only one exception present in the method has an empty body \\
