\section{Assumptions and Dependencies} \label{assump}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A1}: Given the collected data about the distribution and the total number of the taxicabs, we assume that the coverage of the taxicabs among the zones is almost uniform; therefore the probability of having an empty queue is reasonably low.
	\item \textbf{A2}: Given the collected data about the acceptance rate of the taxi drivers, we assume that the probability of reaching the end of the queue without any acceptance is reasonably low.
	\item \textbf{A3}: We assume that the maximum number of people sharing the same ride is 3.
	\item \textbf{A4}: We assume that the taxi driver will correctly follow the optimal route suggested by the system.
\end{itemize}
