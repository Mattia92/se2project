\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system in terms of functional and non functional requirements, analyse the real need of the customer to modelling the system, show the constraints and the limits of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the development. This document is intended to all developers and programmers who have to implement the requirements, to system analysts who want to integrate other systems with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer.

\section{Description of the Problem}
The aim of the project is to optimize a taxi service in order to simplify the access of passengers to the service and guarantee a fair management of taxi queues. Passengers can request a taxi either through a web application or a mobile app. The system answers to the request by informing the passenger about the code of the incoming taxi and the waiting time. Taxi drivers use a mobile application to inform the system about their availability and to confirm that they are going to take care of a certain call. The system guarantees a fair management of taxi queues. In particular, the city is divided in taxi zones (approximately 2 km2 each). Each zone is associated to a queue of taxis. The system automatically computes the distribution of taxis in the various zones based on the GPS information it receives from each taxi. When a taxi is available, its identifier is stored in the queue of taxis in the corresponding zone. When a request arrives from a certain zone, the system forwards it to the first taxi queuing in that zone. If the taxi confirms, then the system will send a confirmation to the passenger. If not, then the system will forward the request to the second in the queue and will, at the same time, move the first taxi in the last position in the queue.
Besides the specific user interfaces for passengers and taxi drivers, the system offers also programmatic interfaces to enable the development of additional services (e.g. taxi sharing) on top of the basic one.
\\ \\
A user can reserve a taxi by specifying the origin and the destination of the ride. The reservation has to occur at least two hours before the ride. In this case, the system confirms the reservation to the user and allocates a taxi to the request 10 minutes before the meeting time with the user.
\\ \\
A user can enable the taxi sharing option. This means that he/she is ready to share a taxi with others if possible, thus sharing the cost of the ride. In this case the user is required to specify the destination of all rides which he/she wants to share with others. If others are willing to start a shared ride from the same zone going in the same direction, then the system arranges the route for the taxi driver, defines the fee for all people sharing the taxi and informs the passengers and the taxi driver.

\section{Goals}
\noindent Passengers should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Login
	\item Sign up
	\item Receive receipts after each completed ride
	\item Request a taxi
	\item Receive informations about the incoming taxi (confirmation, taxi code, waiting time)
	\item Reserve a taxi
	\item Share the ride
\end{itemize}

\noindent Taxi drivers should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Login
	\item Sign up
	\item Signal whether they are available or not
	\item Receive incoming requests
	\item Accept incoming requests
	\item Visualize information about the optimal route
\end{itemize}

\noindent Developers should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Access a specific interface of the system to add new features
\end{itemize}

\section{Domain Properties}
\noindent We suppose that the following properties hold in the analysed domain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accurate taxicabs positions are known by the GPS
	\item Taxi drivers correctly signal their availability
	\item If a passenger requests or reserves a taxi, he will then take the ride from the specified origin to the specified destination
	\item A passenger doesn't change the origin or the destination of a ride after the reservation
	\item If a taxi driver confirms a ride, then he will reach the passenger location on time according to the reservation hour or the waiting time calculated by the system
	\item If a taxi driver confirms a ride, he will complete it
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [A1:] Given the collected data about the distribution and the total number of the taxicabs, we assume that the coverage of the taxicabs among the zones is almost uniform; therefore the probability of having an empty queue is reasonably low.
	\item [A2:] Given the collected data about the acceptance rate of the taxi drivers, we assume that the probability of reaching the end of the queue without any acceptance is reasonably low.
	\item [A3:] We assume that the maximum number of people sharing the same ride is 3.
	\item [A4:] We assume that the taxi driver will correctly follow the optimal route suggested by the system
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}
\begin{description}
	\item[PASSENGER:] is a citizen that benefits of the taxi service
	\item[TAXI DRIVER:] is the owner of a taxicab, and provides a taxi service to citizens
	\item[RIDE:] is the act of make use of the taxi service (provided by a taxi driver) by a passenger
	\item[REQUEST:] is the act performed by a passenger when he immediately needs a taxicab in the location in which he is 
	\item[RESERVATION:] is the act performed by a passenger when he needs a taxicab in a certain future time (at maximum in 2 hours from now) at a certain specific location
	\item[ROUTE:] is the path through the city from the origin of the specific ride to the destination of the specific ride
\end{description}

\section{Proposed System}
The system will be composed by a server running all the business logic, generating dynamic web pages and managing all the accesses to the data sources, and by a number of clients implemented as mobile application deployed on Android or a web application using the JEE platform. GPS raw data will be provided by a specific GPS receiver, installed in every taxicab and provided by a specialized company.

\section{Stakeholders Identification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The government of the city in which the system will be used
	\item The citizens of the city in which the system will be used
	\item The taxi drivers of the city in which the system will be used
	\item A specific IT company which provides all the technology (GPS receivers, smartphones for taxi drivers, mainframes and computational power) in exchange of raw GPS data provided by the receiver used for data mining purposes
\end{itemize}
